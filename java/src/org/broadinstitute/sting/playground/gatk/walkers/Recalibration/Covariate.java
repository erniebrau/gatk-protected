 * The Covariate interface. A Covariate is a feature used in the recalibration that can be picked out of the read, offset, and corresponding reference bases
 * In general most error checking and adjustments to the data are done before the call to the covariates getValue methods in order to speed up the code.
 * This unfortunately muddies the code, but most of these corrections can be done per read while the covariates get called per base, resulting in a big speed up.
